# Doppler_for_AerospaceResearch
Currently the Doppler code consists of bare minimum for the LEO. Thus the project would aim at the following completion of tasks 
Writing the propagation code for different orbits (MEO, GEO, Lunar)
Designing the signal propagation model and integrating it with the orbit propagation code, such that the code would be easily understandable and modular, thus it can be improved at any further time with ease.
Comparing the new code with the old classical doppler shift code to calculate the error from old code.
(Idea) Researching on communication with Mars, while direct line of communication is absent when sun is between earth and mars (it stays this way for 2 months).
